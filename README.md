# PIA Linked Art
[Linked Art](https://linked.art) Modelling for the for the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project. 

Linked Art is an application profile for [CIDOC-CRM](https://cidoc-crm.org/) in JSON-LD. 

## Boilerplates

Below are the boilerplates that are needed within the PIA Data Model in accordance with the [Linked Art API Entity Endpoints](https://linked.art/api/1.0/endpoint/).

| **Visual Works** - Image content worthy of description as distinct entities, such as the image shown by a painting or drawing  | It isn't planned to be leveraged as `VisualItem` are embedded within `DigitalObject` serialisations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

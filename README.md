# PIA Linked Art
[Linked Art](https://linked.art) Modelling for the for the Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital Image Archives (PIA) research project. 

Linked Art is an application profile for [CIDOC-CRM](https://cidoc-crm.org/) in JSON-LD. 

## Boilerplates

Below are the boilerplates that are needed within the PIA Data Model in accordance with the [Linked Art API Entity Endpoints](https://linked.art/api/1.0/endpoint/).

### Main entities

| **Linked Art API Endpoints**                                                                                                   | **SGV Data Model (Class)**      | **Relevance to PIA**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Digital Objects** - Images, services and other digital objects                                                               | `sgv:Object`                    | It will be leveraged and preferred over Physical Objects (for instance for black and white negatives)                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Events** - Events and other non-specific activities that are related but not part of other entities                          | `sgv:Event`                     | A very interesting entity to be used, we need to pinpoint what kind of events are relevant to us as `sgv:Event` is a new class in the SGV Data Model.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Groups** - Groups and Organizations                                                                                          | `sgv:Agent`                     | It is a mix of Groups, Organizations and People at the moment within the SGV Data Model. Data reconciliation needs to be undertaken.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **People** - People                                                                                                            | `sgv:Agent`                     | It is a mix of Groups, Organizations and People at the moment within the SGV Data Model. Data reconciliation needs to be undertaken.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Physical Objects** - Physical things, including artworks, buildings or other architecture, books, parts of objects, and more | `sgv:Object`                    | It is not sure at the moment if it this will be leveraged as an endpoint. `HumanMadeObject` are definitely embedded within `DigitalObject` serialisations if they have been digitised. It will depend on the materiality of the object and how complex they are to be modelled into Linked Art. |
| **Places** - Geographic places                                                                                                 | None                            | Even though the SGV Data Model doesn't have a proper class handling geographic data, this will be leveraged through internal (mainly for the SGV_05 Atlas of Swiss Folklore) and external (Geonames) mappings.                                                                                  |
| **Provenance Activities** - The various events that take place during the history of a physical thing                          | `sgv:Event`                     | A very interesting entity to be used, we need to pinpoint what kind of events are relevant to us as `sgv:Event` is a new class in the SGV Data Model and we may not have well-structured metadata for those kind of activities.                                                                 |
| **Sets** - Sets, including Collections and sets of objects used for exhibitions                                                | `sgv:Collection`, `sgv:Dataset` | It will be leveraged for the official Archives' collections and perhaps it could also be used for user-generated collections and datasets.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Textual Works** - Texts worthy of description as distinct entities, such as the content carried by a book or journal article | None                            | It could be used for the Atlas of Swiss Folklore (SGV_05) as well as for journals referencing photos taken by Ernst Brunner (SGV_12). For the latter, we don't have the data and metadata so it could be quite complex to retrieve those pieces of (meta)information.                           |
| **Visual Works** - Image content worthy of description as distinct entities, such as the image shown by a painting or drawing  | None                            | It isn't planned to be leveraged as `VisualItem` are embedded within `DigitalObject` serialisations                                                                                                                                                                                             |

# Metadata Mapping

Mappings were done in the context of the database migration of the photographic archives of the Swiss Society for Folkflore Studies (SSFS / _Schweizerische Gesellschaft für Volkskunde, SGV_) and for the [PIA research project](https://about.participatory-archives.ch), where different APIs (including IIIF and Linked Art) will be leveraged (see the simplified overview of the PIA Architecture below)

## Models

- Old SSFS/SGV Data Model hosted on [Salsah](ttps://www.salsah.org/)
- New SSFS/SGV Data Model, which has for most of its properties external mapping to [Schema.org](https://schema.org/). It will be hosed on the [DaSCH Service Platform](https://docs.dasch.swiss/) (DSP)
- [PIA JSON API](https://data.participatory-archives.ch/)
- [Linked Art](https://linked.art/)
